<h1 class="heading_style">Humble Beginnings</h1>
<p>The band got their start in the early part of 2024. Guitarist Ben Daugherty was already 
    pretty involved in chattanooga's local jam scene atteneding open improv and jazz nights multiple times a week. It was there that he met drummer Hall Hastings.
After hitting it off pretty quickly, Hall invited Ben over to jam at his house and maybe use that as a jumping off point for a new musical project. Both of them realized quickly
that they would at least need a bassist. Ben had already exchanged only a few words with bassist Brett Tallent as once previously they found themselves at an
open jam night performing a subpar version of Black Sabbath's WarPigs. One night another friend of Ben's called him up and asked him to quickly hop on a gig with him that
night at the chattanooga choo choo. When Ben arrived, he was pleasantly suprised that the backing band that had been quickly assembled consisted of both Brett and Hall.
The gig went incredibly well and not long after Hall invited Brett over to hang and jam with us. Later that year, Ben met saxophonist Neal Brite who was later asked to sit in with us
after that gig Neal offered to keep playing with the band and has been there ever since! </p><br>

<p>Currently the band is frequently performing around the chattanooga area. They are able to engage and attract a large crowd at the majority of shows. The band has
    been spending a considerable amount of time in the studio recording music for upcoming releases. Currently their first release is dropping 3/27/25. The band has numerous 
    small bookings and large festival shows scheduled throughout the year. They couldnt be more honored to be treated as well as they are!
